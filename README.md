This is an School Project

The code under construction is not the ultimate product. Right now, I have a rough understanding of about 50% of it, and in the course of time, I will further develop it. 

I discovered many sources: one of them includes the WebSockets documentation, one tutorial on YouTube, and an article about inter-process communication and socket programming by BMU Verlag.

Through learning I will be able to regularly interact with and change the code to make it even better. Resources:

WebSockets documentation: https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9u_vm9aAmMBMU
